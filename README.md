# Benedikt Herz
            
Welcome to my webpage. I received my PhD in economics from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona. I am currently working as an economist at the European Commission.
On this webpage you can find a list of my research papers and other work in progress. I am mostly interested in applied microeconometrics and policy evaluation. My research covers areas such as labor economics, public economics, as well as economics of innovation and intellectual property rights.
Any opinions expressed on this website do not necessarily reflect those of the European Commission.
