<p style="text-align: justify; white-space: normal;">  
Welcome to my webpage. I received my PhD in economics from the <a href="https://www.econ.upf.edu" target="_blank">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a> in Barcelona. I am currently working as an economist at the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en" target="_blank">European Commission</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; white-space: normal;">  
On this webpage you can find a list of my research papers and other work in progress. I am mostly interested in applied microeconometrics and policy evaluation. My research covers areas such as labor economics, public economics, as well as economics of innovation and intellectual property rights.</p>
